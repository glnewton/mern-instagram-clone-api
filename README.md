# MERN Instagram Clone API

## Introduction

This is the back-end API for a MERN stack Instagram Clone. It uses Node with Express as the server, Mongoose as the ORM, and MongoDB as the database. The API is responsible for handling user-generated content, such as messages and comments. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a React front-end. It has two main models, Message and Comment, which are used to interact with the MongoDB.
